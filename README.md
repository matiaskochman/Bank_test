# Advanced Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
node scripts/deploy.js
npx eslint '**/*.js'
npx eslint '**/*.js' --fix
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --check
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --write
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol' --fix
```

# Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum network that's supported by Etherscan, such as Ropsten.

In this project, copy the .env.example file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Ropsten node URL (eg from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network ropsten scripts/deploy.js
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network ropsten DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Hello, Hardhat!"
```



The following technical test has been adapted from a security hackaton in order to demonstrate the technical skills of our senior developers.

## The Challenge

For this challenge you must develop the project according to the guidelines. 

1. Create a public repository in Github or any other similar service
2. Commit regularly to check your progress
3. Email us the repository URL
4. Deadline is on January 13th 10pm UTC -5. However, the earliest the better.

## The Project

The goal of this phase is to develop one smart contract that conforms to a given interface and passes a given test suite. After these contracts are implemented, they must be deployed on theÂ [Goerli test network](https://goerli.net/). Here are the main points and rules

1. Build a smart contract system that can be used as aÂ [lending platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance).
2. Tropykus provides the [interface](https://www.notion.so/Functional-Requirements-IBank-Interface-HAK-Token-and-Oracle-Addresses-ce22fe19a5a6461d90dabd89790e7657) that MUST be used for the implementation.
3. Tropykus provides the address of anÂ [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)Â contract called the [HAK token](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xbefeed4cb8c6dd190793b1c97b72b60272f3ea6c), which can be deposited in the bank as collateral for borrowing ETH. You can get Goerli ETH from [https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)
4. Tropykus will provide a test suite to verify that the implemented code functions properly. Teams that do not pass all tests will be penalized i.e. their final HAK token balance will be divided by the number of tests failed + 1.
5. You MUST deploy their smart contract(s) on the Goerli test network by the deadline.

## Functional Requirements, IBank Interface, HAK Token and Oracle Addresses

ðŸ’¡ **DISCLAIMER:**Â All contracts developed and provided for and during this challenge are not safe and should not be used in production systems!

</aside>

### **Functional Requirements**

In the following text, we use the terms "user" and "bank customer" interchangeably. The following functional requirements must be satisfied by the implementation of the smart contract(s):

1. A bank customer's account is represented by their wallet address.
2. A bank customer must be able to deposit an amount higher than 0 of tokens into their own account. Deposits can be made in HAK and ETH for the purpose of this challenge.
3. A bank customer must be able to withdraw only up to the amount they deposited into their own account + interest accrued.
4. When withdrawing a deposit, the user will automatically receive interest on their deposit of 3% per 100 blocks. If a user withdraws their deposit earlier or later than 100 blocks, they will receive a proportional interest amount.
5. A bank customer must be able to deposit multiple times in the same account and if so, the interest should be accounted for each time deposit and withdraw are called by that user.
6. Interest must not be compounding. This means that interest is earned only on the deposited amount and not on the accumulated interest itself.
7. A bank customer must be able to borrow ETH from the bank using the HAK token as collateral.
8. The minimum collateral ratio for any loan is 150%. This means that the value of HAK tokens deposited by the user taking out the loan (plus interest), divided by the ETH value borrowed by the same user (plus interest), must be greater or equal to 150%, that is:Â `(deposits[account] + accruedInterest[account]) * 10000 / (borrowed[account] + owedInterest[account]) >= 15000`.
9. If the collateral ratio for an outstanding loan goes below 150%, then anyone must be able to repay the loan and receive the collateral tokens in exchange for repaying the loan. We call this a "liquidation" of the loan. During liquidation, the debt of the borrower must be erased AND the borrower loses their deposit, which is transferred to the liquidator.
10. A borrower must be able to repay their loan in full or partially at any point in time if they have not been liquidated.
11. Repaying a loan involves paying the borrowed amount, plus an interest rate of 5% of the borrowed amount, per 100 blocks.
12. Anyone must be able to check the current collateral ratio of any account at any point in time.
13. Each of the 5 state-changing functions defined in the `IBank` interface must emit the corresponding event defined at the top of the interface with the correct parameters as specified in the code comments for each event. The view function in the interface does not need to emit any event.
14. The constructor of the `Bank` contract that you write MUST have exactly 2 input parameters. The first parameter must be the address of the price oracle contract. The second input parameter must be the address of the HAK token contract.

Function-specific requirements are written in the code comments of the mandatoryÂ `IBank`Â interface below.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. The implementation must use Solidity version 0.7.0, that isÂ `pragma solidity 0.7.0`Â MUST be at the beginning of the source file.

### **Mandatory Interface**

The following interface must be implemented by the implemented smart contract(s):

```jsx
pragma solidity 0.7.0;

interface IBank {
    struct Account { // Note that token values have an 18 decimal precision
        uint256 deposit;           // accumulated deposits made into the account
        uint256 interest;          // accumulated interest
        uint256 lastInterestBlock; // block at which interest was last computed
    }
    // Event emitted when a user makes a deposit
    event Deposit(
        address indexed _from, // account of user who deposited
        address indexed token, // token that was deposited
        uint256 amount // amount of token that was deposited
    );
    // Event emitted when a user makes a withdrawal
    event Withdraw(

    );
    // Event emitted when a user borrows funds
    event Borrow(
        address indexed _from, // account who borrowed the funds
        address indexed token, // token that was borrowed
        uint256 amount, // amount of token that was borrowed

    event Repay(
        address indexed _from, // accout which repaid the loan
        address indexed token, // token that was borrowed and repaid
        uint256 remainingDebt // amount that still remains to be paid (including interest)
    );
    // Event emitted when a loan is liquidated
    event Liquidate(
        address indexed liquidator, // account which performs the liquidation
        address indexed accountLiquidated, // account which is liquidated
        address indexed collateralToken, // token which was used as collateral
                                         // for the loan (not the token borrowed)
        uint256 amountOfCollateral, // amount of collateral token which is sent to the liquidator
        uint256 amountSentBack // amount of borrowed token that is sent back to the
                               // liquidator in case the amount that the liquidator
                               // sent for liquidation was higher than the debt of the liquidated account

### **The HAK token and its price oracle**

- The HAK token is a typical ERC20 token deployed at this address: [https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xbefeed4cb8c6dd190793b1c97b72b60272f3ea6c](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xbefeed4cb8c6dd190793b1c97b72b60272f3ea6c)
- In order to get the price of the HAK token in ETH, which will allow you to compute the collateral ratio, use the followingÂ `PriceOracle`Â contract: [https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xc3F639B8a6831ff50aD8113B438E2Ef873845552](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xc3F639B8a6831ff50aD8113B438E2Ef873845552)
- TheÂ `PriceOracle`Â contract implements the following simple interface that should be used when implementing the Bank:

```jsx
pragma solidity 0.7.0;

interface IPriceOracle {
    /**
     * The purpose of this function is to retrieve the price of the given token
     * in ETH. For example if the price of a HAK token is worth 0.5 ETH, then
     * this function will return 500000000000000000 (5e17) because ETH has 18 
     * decimals. Note that this price is not fixed and might change at any moment,
     * according to the demand and supply on the open market.
     * @param token - the ERC20 token for which you want to get the price in ETH.
     * @return - the price in ETH of the given token at that moment in time.
     */
    function getVirtualPrice(address token) view external returns (uint256);
}
```

**NOTE:** TheÂ `PriceOracle`Â contract has its code published on Etherscan and it may contain vulnerabilities. Attacking theÂ `PriceOracle`Â or the HAK token contracts is allowed in Phase 2 of this challenge (see Phase 2 description below).
